### Important Points To Note
1. Please read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/just-notes/blob/master/contributing.md) to start with the UI contribution. **_Create each screen in separate branches_**.

2. Make sure to keep the reusable components of the screen (like navbar, sidebar) in a separate folder called `partial` inside `components`and use it while designing screens.

3. We are using Bootstrap CSS as the base of the project so that making the layout becomes faster. However, the components will be designed according to the design guidelines and the mockups screens. Make custom stylesheets for every screen and place them inside components folder.

4. For the icons, Font Awesome can be used.

5. There are no fixed dimensions for the elements in the project as those will be determined by the relative sizes of the screen. Please make sure these sizes adapts to different screen sizes including mobile screens and also the layout changes accordingly for mobiles. 

6. Refer to the below screens for the UI that needs to be built.
